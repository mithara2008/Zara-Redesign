# **Zara Website Redesign: A UX Case Study**

## **Project Overview**
Our team undertook the challenge of redesigning the **Zara website** as part of our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project. While Zara is a well-established fashion brand, its website presented several usability issues that hindered a smooth shopping experience. Our goal was to create an **intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing** interface that enhances navigation, searchability, and overall user experience.

## **The Design Challenge**
Through our initial assessment, we identified key usability problems on Zaraâ€™s website:
- **Complex navigation** made it difficult for users to find products quickly.
- **Poor search functionality** led to frustration and inefficiency.
- **Lack of clear product details** such as reviews and ratings reduced customer trust.
- **Unintuitive filtering options** made it harder to browse products effectively.
- **Missing customer support information** left users uncertain about returns and inquiries.

## **User Research Findings**
To validate our findings, we conducted **three user interviews** with novice, intermediate, and expert Zara shoppers. Key insights included:
- Users struggled to **locate specific products** due to confusing navigation.
- Many found the **lack of product reviews and ratings** a major drawback.
- The checkout process was **not seamless**, making it harder to complete purchases.
- Users preferred a **more structured and visually engaging layout** to enhance browsing.

## **Design Solutions Implemented**
Based on our research, we redesigned Zaraâ€™s website with these improvements:
- **Enhanced Navigation:** A more intuitive menu structure for easy browsing.
- **Improved Search & Filtering:** A robust filtering system to quickly find desired products.
- **Better Product Pages:** Added customer reviews, ratings, and clear size options.
- **Streamlined Checkout:** Simplified the checkout process for faster transactions.
- **User-Centered UI:** A modern and visually appealing design using **Figma**.
