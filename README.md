# Zara-Redesign
Redesigned the Zara website using Figma to enhance user experience and resolve usability issues. Improvements included streamlined navigation, optimized homepage layout, simplified product pages, and intuitive filters. Enhanced visuals, clear call-to-action buttons, and faster load times created a modern, user-friendly, and accessible interface.
